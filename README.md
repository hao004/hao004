ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zi Hao

I am a student currently studying A-levels in Malaysia with an interest in physics and astronomy. I started programming three years ago using python to execute simple tasks required by syllabus in school courses. On github, I hope to able to share my ideas to everyone and incorporate programming to different science projects to make things easier.
